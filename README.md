# twitter_clone

Hey, HI!

This is new project i started to go with .
As name said it's going to be TWITTER CLONE to be made on Flutter .

**To-do list**
```
    1) Making a impressive cutting edge cross-platform app like a clone of twitter.
    2) Will be using Google authentication for Signup and Sign In .
    3) CloudFirestore will be used to r/w data .
    4) Sleek design is first priority .
    5) For state management use BLoC by Felix Angelov .
    6) Responsive design .
    7) For local storage we will be using HIVE (no-sql) and 20x times more faster then SQLite.
    8) Have fun! .
```

**How to start**
Make your own branch and just go with it .
If find any kind of issue just open an issue and give some required information .

Go for a merge request when sure .
